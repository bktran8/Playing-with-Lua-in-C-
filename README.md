### OVERVIEW
This project was an introduction to Lua and how it can be binded within C/C++.

**1.prog3_1.cpp** creates a lua environment within this C++ file that allows execution of a lua file. 

**2.prog3_2.lua** contains a function that converts strings from infix to postfix. Instead of arrays and basic loops, lua implements tables and more strict statement formatting i.e **while** exp **do** block **end** etc.

**3.pro3_3.cpp** is an extension of prog3_1 but executes, specifically, the lua function that was created in prog3_2.
